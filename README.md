### Hello there

Allow me to introduce myself: 
I am a Coast Guard veteran, classically trained chef, and eager full-stack web developer proficient in JavaScript and Ruby. I specialized in Rails and React.js while going through the software engineering program at FlatIron School. My insatiable curiosity and strong work ethic drive me to continuously expand my programming expertise. I am known for asking insightful questions that propel me towards continuous learning and growth in the dynamic field of computer programming.
